'''

print(17/9)
print(17//9)
print(17%9)

#I was correct on all of them. =)

'''
4. Write a a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.
'''

height=int(input("Enter Height: "))
base=int(input("Enter Base: "))
print()

'''
5. Change this program so it works.
A=May the Force be with you!
print(a)
'''




'''
6. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the length of a square's
side and then print the area of the square
'''



'''7. Ask a user for the length of radii of an ellipse and then print its area. 
Area=pi*a*b where a and b are the lengths of the major radii.
'''



'''
8. Ask a user for moles, volume and temperature of a gas and print out the pressure. PV=nRT where n is the number of moles, T is the absolute temperature, V is the
volume, and R is the gas constant 8.3144.
'''

'''
9. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.
'''


'''
10. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. Ask the user for mass and acceleration
and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
